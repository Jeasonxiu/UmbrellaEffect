#' @title Surface grid
#'
#' @description Generates a 2d grid of the surface of topography at the observatory building.
#' This is done on basis of a DEM or assuming a flat surface.
#'
#' @param DEM Character string, containing the name of the DEM-file to use.
#' If left empty, a flat topography with value 0 (zero) will be assumed.
#' @param grid_domain_x test
#' @param input_dir Character string, specifying the path of the directory where the DEM-file is located.
#' @param output_dir Character string, specifying the path of the directory where output should be stored.
#' 
#' @return Returns a data.frame, which holds topographical information, including x,y coordinates,
#' from the area of the SG building.
